# Characters page + Discord notifications (copy/paste)

Hey all — I’ve added a new **Characters hub** in my app: **`/characters`**.

It’s a dashboard to manage your linked pilots + accounts, but the **main differentiator vs spreadsheets** is: **it can DM you on Discord when things need attention**.

## What you can do on `/characters`

- **Character linking**: link/unlink characters via ESI, set a primary
- **Account grouping**: group characters into “accounts” (ex: *Skill Farm #1*), assign/unassign pilots
- **Status + visibility**: token status, wallet totals, skill points, and training queue status per character
- **Timers**: track **PLEX + MCT** per account and **boosters** per character

## Notifications (the big part)

Optional **Discord DM alerts** for:

- **PLEX / MCT / Booster expiring** (around **~3d**, **~1d**, and **at expiry**)  
  *(sent as a grouped daily summary so it’s useful, not spammy)*
- **Training queue idle** (you have active training time, but not enough queues actually running)
- **Skill plan completion reminders** (**3d / 1d / 1h** before completion)

## How to enable it

1. Go to **`/settings/notifications`**
2. **Connect Discord**
3. Toggle what you want + **Save Preferences**
4. Hit **Send Test** to confirm it works

## Feedback I’d love

- What’s **useful** vs **noise**?
- Any **timing/thresholds** you’d want different?
- What’s **missing** that would make you use it weekly?

Thanks in advance — ping me here or DM feedback.
