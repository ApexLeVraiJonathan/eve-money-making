---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Arbitrage Planning

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/planner`

### Plan Buy Opportunities

- [x] Edit JSON payload or use quick params to configure:
  - [x] Package capacity (m¬≥)
  - [x] Investment ISK
  - [x] Max packages
  - [x] Per-item share
  - [x] Shipping costs by station
- [x] Click "Run planner" ‚Üí Loading indicator appears

- [x] Items saved as `CycleLine` records linked to current cycle

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cycle Lines Management

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/lines` (ADMIN-ONLY PAGE)

### View Cycle Lines

**Note**: This page requires the `alert-dialog` component to be installed first:

```bash
cd apps/web && npx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog
```

- [x] Navigate via "Manage Lines" link in admin sidebar (under Cycles)
- [x] Page automatically loads latest open cycle (or most recent if none open)
- [x] Can optionally override with query parameter: `/arbitrage/admin/lines?cycleId=your-cycle-id`
- [x] Page shows which cycle is being used (first 8 characters of cycle ID)
- [x] See list of all planned items for the cycle
- [x] Each line shows:
  - [x] Item type name
  - [x] Destination station name
  - [x] Planned units
  - [x] Units bought (initially 0)
  - [x] Units sold (initially 0)
  - [x] Units remaining (calculated)
  - [x] Buy cost ISK
  - [x] Sales revenue ISK
  - [x] Broker fees ISK
  - [x] Relist fees ISK

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Buying Phase

**Location**: In-game EVE Online + Admin triggers

### Execute Buys In-Game

- [x] Log in to BUYER character in-game
- [x] Navigate to Jita (or source station)
- [x] Buy items from cycle lines using market orders
- [x] Note: Buys can be partial (multiple orders for same item)

### Import Wallet Transactions

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/triggers`

- [x] Navigate to "Wallets" tab
- [x] Set "Days back" parameter (e.g., 15)
- [x] Click "Import Wallets" button with refresh icon
- [x] Toast shows "Importing wallet transactions..."
- [x] After completion, success message with count
- [x] Verify in backend console/logs that transactions imported

### Run Buy Allocation

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/triggers` ‚Üí "Jobs" tab

- [x] Look for "Run Wallets" button (imports + allocates)
- [x] Click button ‚Üí System:
  1. Imports latest wallet transactions
  2. Runs allocation for buys
  3. Runs allocation for sells
- [x] Check backend logs for allocation results:
  - [x] Number of buy transactions allocated
  - [x] Number of cycle lines updated
  - [x] Any errors or unmatched transactions

### Verify Buy Allocations

**Method 1 - Frontend** (if lines page is working):
**Location**: `/arbitrage/cycles/[cycleId]/lines`

- [x] Return to cycle lines page
- [x] Verify `Units Bought` increased for affected lines
- [x] Verify `Buy Cost ISK` updated with total cost
- [x] Check `Units Remaining` = `Planned Units` initially (since nothing sold yet)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Transport & Listing Phase

### Transport Items

- [x] Move items in-game from source to destination station (manual, out-of-game via contract service)
- [x] **Important**: Contract tracking is NOT currently working from ESI
- [x] **Important**: No automatic way to match transport contracts to cycles

### Record Broker Fees (Initial Listing)

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/sell-appraiser`

**Why manual tracking matters**: Broker fees (1.5%) are charged when you CREATE the sell order, NOT when items sell. If you list at 100 ISK but later sell at 90 ISK, the broker fee was still based on 100 ISK. This is why we can't infer broker fees from sell transactions.

**Workflow**:

- [x] Navigate to `/arbitrage/admin/sell-appraiser`
- [x] Check "Use latest open commit" (should auto-load current cycle)
- [x] Click "Appraise" ‚Üí System fetches remaining inventory and suggests prices
- [x] Review suggested prices (based on current market lowest sell)
- [x] Check items you're listing
- [x] List items in-game at the suggested prices
- [x] Return to appraiser page
- [x] Click "Confirm Listed" ‚Üí Records 1.5% broker fee for selected items

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Selling Phase

### Execute Sells In-Game

- [x] Log in to SELLER character in-game
- [x] Items sell gradually via market orders at destination station
- [x] Note: Multiple partial sales may occur
- [x] **Important**: Seller character's `location` in database MUST match the destination station for sells to allocate correctly

### Import Wallet Transactions & Run Allocation

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/triggers` ‚Üí "Jobs" tab

- [x] Click "Run Wallets" button (same as buy phase)
- [x] System automatically:
  1. Imports latest wallet transactions (buys AND sells)
  2. Runs buy allocation
  3. Runs sell allocation
- [x] Check backend logs for results

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£.5Ô∏è‚É£ Price Management & Relist Fees

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/undercut-checker`

### Check for Undercuts

**Why this matters**: Competitors may list items cheaper than you. The undercut checker identifies your orders that need price updates to remain competitive.

**Workflow**:

- [x] Navigate to `/arbitrage/admin/undercut-checker`
- [x] Check "Use latest open commit" (should auto-load current cycle)
- [x] Click "Run Check" ‚Üí System compares your sell orders vs market
- [x] Results grouped by character and station
- [x] Each row shows:
  - [x] Item name
  - [x] Remaining quantity
  - [x] Your current price
  - [x] Competitor's lowest price
  - [x] Suggested new price (0.01 ISK cheaper, with tick rounding)
  - [x] **Calculated relist fee** (0.3% of new order value)
- [x] Total relist fee shown at bottom for selected items

### Record Relist Fees

- [x] Review suggested prices and relist fees
- [x] Select items you want to reprice (checkboxes)
- [x] Update prices in-game to match suggested prices
- [x] Return to undercut checker page
- [x] Click "Confirm Repriced" ‚Üí Records 0.3% relist fee for selected items

**Important**: Relist fees are 0.3% of the NEW order value (remaining quantity √ó new price), NOT the original listing price. This is why the undercut checker calculates and displays them.

**Note**: The frontend currently uses `planCommitId` but backend expects cycle-based parameters. The API endpoints need updating to match new system.

**Alternative - Manual API call per line**:

```bash
POST /api/ledger/cycles/lines/{lineId}/relist-fee
Body: { "amountIsk": "30000" }  # 0.3% of new order value
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Profit Calculation & Snapshots

**Location**: `/arbitrage/cycles/[cycleId]/profit` (NEW PAGE - may need component installation)

### View Cycle Profit Breakdown

**Note**: This page requires the same frontend fixes as the lines page.

**Method 1 - Frontend** (if profit page is working):

- [x] Navigate via "View Profit" link from `/arbitrage/cycles`
- [x] See overall profit summary with all fees and net profit

### Create Manual Snapshot

**Using API**:

```bash
POST /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}/snapshot
```

Snapshot includes:

- [x] Current wallet cash balance
- [x] Current inventory value (WAC-based)
- [x] Current cycle profit
- [x] Timestamp

### View Snapshots

**Using API**:

```bash
GET /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}/snapshots
```

- [x] Returns list of all snapshots ordered by time
- [x] Each shows: `walletCashIsk`, `inventoryIsk`, `cycleProfitIsk`, `snapshotAt`
- [x] Can compare progression over time

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Closing Cycle

**Location**: `/arbitrage/cycles` or `/arbitrage/admin/cycles`

### Close Cycle

**Note**: The UI for closing cycles is in the admin section.

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/cycles`

- [ ] Find the current open cycle
- [ ] Click close/end cycle action
- [ ] Confirm ‚Üí Cycle status changes to "Closed"
- [ ] `closedAt` timestamp set

### Verify Final State

- [ ] Check cycle via API: `GET /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}`
- [ ] Verify `closedAt` is set
- [ ] Get final profit: `GET /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}/profit`
- [ ] All cycle lines show final units bought/sold
- [ ] Transport fees accounted for
- [ ] System ready for payout calculation (if participations exist)

---

## üîü Payout Calculation & Distribution

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/participations` or API

### Calculate Payouts

**Prerequisites**:

- [ ] Cycle is closed (`closedAt` is set)
- [ ] All participations validated
- [ ] Final profit calculated

**Payout Formula**:

1. **Pool size** = Cycle profit √ó pool % (e.g., 50% goes to investors)
2. **Each investor's share** = (Their investment / Total investments) √ó Pool
3. **Payout** = Investment + Share of profit

### Verify Payout Calculations

**Example scenario**:

- Cycle profit: 1,000,000,000 ISK (1B)
- Pool %: 50%
- Pool available: 500,000,000 ISK (500M)
- Investor A: invested 300M (60% of 500M total)
- Investor B: invested 200M (40% of 500M total)

**Expected payouts**:

- Investor A: 300M + (500M √ó 0.6) = 300M + 300M = **600M** (100% return)
- Investor B: 200M + (500M √ó 0.4) = 200M + 200M = **400M** (100% return)

**Verification checklist**:

- [ ] Verify math matches expected
- [ ] Verify all validated investors included
- [ ] Verify investment percentages sum to 100%
- [ ] Verify total payouts ‚â§ Total investments + Pool

### Record Payout Decisions

**Location**: Admin UI or API

Once payouts calculated and verified:

```bash
POST /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}/participations/{participationId}/payout
Body: {
  "payoutAmountIsk": "600000000",
  "memo": "Cycle profit payout - 100% return"
}
```

- [ ] Updates participation with `payoutAmountIsk`
- [ ] Creates ledger entry for payout
- [ ] Can mark as "paid" once ISK sent

### Send Payouts In-Game

- [ ] Log in to EVE Online with designated character
- [ ] For each validated participation:
  - [ ] Send calculated payout amount
  - [ ] Include memo (e.g., "Cycle [name] payout - [return]% return")
  - [ ] Send to investor character specified in participation

### Mark Payouts as Paid

**Location**: `/arbitrage/admin/participations`

- [ ] Find each participation
- [ ] Click "Mark as Paid" or similar action
- [ ] `payoutPaidAt` timestamp set
- [ ] Status ‚Üí "completed"

**Alternative - API**:

```bash
PATCH /api/ledger/cycles/{cycleId}/participations/{participationId}
Body: { "payoutPaidAt": "2025-10-15T23:59:59Z" }
```

### Verify Complete Payout Cycle

**Database verification**:

```sql
-- Check all participations paid
SELECT
  cp.id,
  cp.amount_isk,
  cp.payout_amount_isk,
  cp.status,
  cp.payout_paid_at,
  (cp.payout_amount_isk - cp.amount_isk) / cp.amount_isk * 100 as return_pct
FROM cycle_participations cp
WHERE cp.cycle_id = 'your-cycle-id';
```

- [ ] All participations have `payout_amount_isk` set
- [ ] All have `payout_paid_at` timestamp
- [ ] Return % is consistent across investors (proportional to pool share)
- [ ] Total payouts match expected pool distribution

**Cycle ledger verification**:

```sql
-- Check ledger balance
SELECT
  entry_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount::numeric) as total_isk
FROM cycle_ledger
WHERE cycle_id = 'your-cycle-id'
GROUP BY entry_type
ORDER BY entry_type;
```

- [ ] "deposit" entries = total investor investments
- [ ] "payout" entries = total payouts sent
- [ ] Difference = operator's profit share

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Multiple Buys for Same Line

- [ ] Buy same item multiple times (partial orders)
- [ ] Import transactions
- [ ] Run allocation
- [ ] Verify all buys aggregated correctly on same line
- [ ] `unitsBought` = sum of all buy quantities
- [ ] `buyCostIsk` = sum of all buy costs

### Sells to Wrong Destination

- [ ] SELLER character sells item at wrong station
- [ ] Run sell allocation
- [ ] System should:
  - [ ] Not match to any cycle line (destination mismatch)
  - [ ] Log unmatched transaction
  - [ ] Show warning in allocation results

### Manual Allocation Fixes

- [ ] If auto-allocation fails or mismatches
- [ ] Can manually adjust cycle line values:
  - [ ] Edit `unitsBought` or `unitsSold`
  - [ ] Edit cost/revenue amounts
  - [ ] Add manual fee entries

### Concurrent Cycles

- [ ] Create multiple cycles (one open, one planned)
- [ ] Ensure buy/sell allocations only affect correct cycle
- [ ] Verify lines are isolated per cycle

### Zero-Profit or Loss Scenarios

- [ ] Create cycle with intentionally bad arbitrage
- [ ] Execute buys/sells at a loss
- [ ] Verify profit calculation shows negative value
- [ ] System handles negative profit correctly
- [ ] Verify payouts still return principal to investors (loss absorbed by operator)

### Multiple Participations per Cycle

- [ ] Create cycle with 3+ different investors
- [ ] Validate all participations
- [ ] Close cycle and calculate payouts
- [ ] Verify each investor gets correct proportional share
- [ ] Verify total payouts = sum of individual payouts

### Late/Invalid Participation

- [ ] Investor opts in but never sends ISK
- [ ] Participation remains "pending"
- [ ] Close cycle
- [ ] Verify pending participations excluded from payout
- [ ] Only validated participations receive payouts

### Wrong Memo or Amount

- [ ] Investor sends ISK with wrong memo
- [ ] Auto-validation fails
- [ ] Admin manually validates with correct journal entry
- [ ] Participation status ‚Üí "validated"
- [ ] Payout calculation includes corrected participation

### Partial ISK Transfer

- [ ] Investor commits 500M but only sends 300M
- [ ] Auto-validation fails (amount mismatch)
- [ ] Admin options:
  - [ ] Reject participation (refund)
  - [ ] Adjust participation amount to 300M
  - [ ] Wait for investor to send remaining 200M
- [ ] Verify chosen action works correctly

## üêõ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buys not allocating

- **Check**: Wallet transactions imported for buyer character?
- **Check**: Cycle has matching cycle lines (typeId matches)?
- **Fix**: Import transactions, ensure cycle lines exist

### Issue: Sells not allocating

- **Check**: Seller character has `location` set in database?
- **Check**: Location matches destination station on cycle line?
- **Fix**: Update character location, ensure destination matches

### Issue: Profit seems wrong

- **Check**: All fees recorded (broker, relist, transport)?
- **Check**: Verify buy cost and sales revenue amounts
- **Fix**: Manually add missing fees, check allocations

### Issue: Frontend build fails

- **Expected**: Missing `alert-dialog` component and `apiClient` import
- **Fix**:
  ```bash
  cd apps/web
  npx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog
  # Fix import in apps/web/app/api/cycles/lines.ts
  # Change: import { apiClient } from "@/lib/api-client";
  # To: import { fetchWithAuth } from "@/lib/api-client";
  ```

### Issue: Participation not validating

- **Check**: Wallet journal imported for receiving character?
- **Check**: Exact memo used in ISK transfer?
- **Check**: Amount matches exactly (no rounding errors)?
- **Fix**: Re-import journal, manually validate if needed

### Issue: Payout math doesn't add up

- **Check**: Is cycle closed and final profit calculated?
- **Check**: Are all fees included (broker, relist, transport)?
- **Check**: Is pool % configured correctly (e.g., 0.5 for 50%)?
- **Fix**: Verify profit calculation, recalculate payouts

### Issue: Some investors missing from payout

- **Check**: Are all participations validated (not just pending)?
- **Check**: Were they opted in before cycle closed?
- **Fix**: Validate pending participations, recalculate
