description: Core rules for all packages/apps in the monorepo
globs:

PRINCIPLES

- KISS, DRY, YAGNI. Make minimal, on-task changes.
- Preserve/update useful comments/docs; do not delete them.
- Respect existing patterns (naming, folders, API client, query keys). If unsure, ask one clarifying question.
- Use strict TypeScript; avoid `any`. Put reusable types in packages/shared.

MONOREPO

- Apps live in apps/_ ; shared code in packages/_ .
- Apps must not import each other; share via packages/\* only.
- Centralize env access in typed helpers (no scattered `process.env`).

EXAMPLES

- ❌ Re-declare User in an app. ✅ `import type { User } from "@shared/types"`
- ❌ Create a new fetch wrapper. ✅ `import { clientForApp } from "@api-client"`
