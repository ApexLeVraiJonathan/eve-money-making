description: Core rules for all packages/apps in the monorepo
globs:
  - "**/*"

PRINCIPLES

- KISS, DRY, YAGNI. Make minimal, on-task changes.
- Preserve/update useful comments/docs; do not delete them.
- Respect existing patterns (naming, folders, API client, query keys). If unsure, ask one clarifying question.
- Use strict TypeScript; avoid `any`. Put reusable types in packages/shared.

MONOREPO

- Apps live in apps/_ ; shared code in packages/_ .
- Apps must not import each other; share via packages/\* only.
- Centralize env access in typed helpers (no scattered `process.env`).

EXAMPLES

- ❌ Re-declare User in an app. ✅ `import type { User } from "@shared/types"`
- ❌ Create a new fetch wrapper. ✅ `import { clientForApp } from "@api-client"`

## Visual Change Verification

When making UI/layout changes:

1. ALWAYS take before/after screenshots
2. ALWAYS check for unwanted scrollbars (page scroll vs section scroll)
3. ALWAYS verify at the requested resolution (e.g., 1920x1080)
4. "Filling space" means using viewport space efficiently, NOT expanding beyond viewport
5. Mark TODOs complete only when the PROBLEM is solved, not when code changes execute
