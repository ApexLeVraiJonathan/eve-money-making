description: Prevent the agent from starting/stopping dev servers or long-running processes

# No process management without explicit user request

The agent **must not** start, stop, restart, kill, or otherwise manage long-running processes unless the user explicitly asks.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- `pnpm run dev:*`, `npm run dev`, `nest start --watch`, `next dev`
- Docker containers / compose stacks
- Backgrounded shells, watchers, schedulers, etc.

## Required behavior

- **Do not start** new dev servers/watchers if one appears to already be running.
- **Do not stop/kill** any existing dev server/watch process.
- If a change requires a restart to take effect, **tell the user** what command to run and why, but **do not execute it**.
- If a port conflict or stuck process is suspected, **ask the user** to restart/stop it (provide exact command), but **do not terminate it yourself**.

## Exceptions

Only allowed if the user explicitly requests it in the current conversation, e.g.:

- “Restart the API server”
- “Stop the dev server and start it again”
- “Kill the process on port 3000”
